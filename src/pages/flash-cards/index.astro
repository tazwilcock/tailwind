         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-5">Websites allow the website owner to communicate with the end user. This is typically done through audio, text, images, and video. For example: product name, product description, product image...</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Websites also allow the user to communicate with the website owner. This is typically done through a Web Form. If a customer wants a product they use a form to add it to their cart, and another form to make a purchase.</p>

            Pain vs Reward
         </p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">The pain of filling out a form needs to be less than the reward of filling it out. For instance, a reward for filling out a form could be purchasing a product, accessing certain information, being able to attend an event, etc. Make sure that forms are easy or even fun to fill out. </p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">See best practices below</p>

         </h2>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">1. Proper Labeling</span> Every form should have a proper title that accurately describes what it's for. User's need to be able to instantly describe the purpose. Instead of just putting purchase, add what will be purchased: "Purchase Concert Tickets". Never use the word submit for the submit button. Instead state this phrase as if you were the user: "I want to..." the word that comes after to is the word the submit button should say. To go with our last example the submit button would say: "Purchase My Tickets". </p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">2. Content</span> Forms are BARRIERS THAT STAND BETWEEN THE USER AND WHAT THEY WANT. Only ask <span class="text-pink-500">ESSENTIAL</span> questions. With the example of a user signing up for a community email. Only a name and an email address or maybe even only an email address is essential. Unnessasary form fields would be job title, phone, company name, address...</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">NOTE: never put form field labels next to the form field. Always put them above or inside the form field. That way, the eye tracking path makes a straight vertical line from top to bottom.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">3. Layout </span>Use a <span class="text-pink-500">Single Column</span> for forms. Never use multiple columns.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Note on phone numbers. Use one field to allow for multiple phone number arrangements. Not all phone numbers in all contries are the same length or in the same format.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Note on Radio Buttons and Dropdowns. Use check boxes or radio buttons when a question has <span class="text-pink-500">5 options or less. </span>Use a dropdown when a question has more than 5 options.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">4. Inputs</span> Every form should have a proper title that accurately describes what it's for. User's need to be able to instantly describe the purpose. Instead of just putting purchase, add what will be purchased: "Purchase Concert Tickets". Never use the word submit for the submit button. Instead state this phrase as if you were the user: "I want to..." the word that comes after to is the word the submit button should say. To go with our last example the submit button would say: "Purchase My Tickets". </p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Placeholder text should not replace labels because once a user starts typing they could forget what they are supposed to be typing. Always have the label visible.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Order choices logically. For Instance, order days of the week in the right order of course, but also if there isn't a logical sequence use alphabetical order.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-5">Wrap all inputs in <span class="text-pink-500">LABEL TAGS. </span>This helps with touching small items like check boxes and radio buttons. Users are also able to click or touch the label and not just the input. </p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">5. Submissions</span> Never put a reset or clear button on your form. Someone who wants to start over can just reload the page. Another submission tip is to SHOW THE USER a CONFIRMATION message so that they know the submission worked.</p>
         <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto my-5"><span class="text-3xl text-amber-200">6. Design</span> Make sure your touch points are at least 44 pixels tall. 45-50px makes it easier for users. Also, group the labels and the proper fields. Group and separate matching labels and fields so they are distinct from other labels and thier fields.</p>
